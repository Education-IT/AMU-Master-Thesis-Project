# R&D Project {AMU-Master-Thesis }

### Title: "Evaluation of Large Language Models Integrated with External Knowledge."

#### Concept and Action Plan:

1. We evaluate the model's standard response to a given test question.

2. We evaluate the model's response to the same test question with additional context [RAG â€“ snippets from the browser].

3. We compare the results.

#### As part of the project, I use:
1. LM-evaluation-harness
2. SearXNG
3. Brave Search Engine API
4. LLMs & benchmarks
