        "Officials at a large community hospital report an increased incidence of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) among children aged 5 – 12. They point out that some households in the community are exposed to chemical waste from a nearby factory. They believe that chemical waste causes leukemia. If a study is designed to evaluate the hospital officials’ claim, which of the following subjects are most likely to comprise the control group?",
        "A new drug with in vitro activity against HIV is tested on a population of patients with Western-blot confirmed HIV infections. Out of the 200 individuals in the patient population, 100 are chosen by lottery to receive the drug. The drug, which is tasteless, is administered in a cup of orange juice; the other patients receive pure orange juice. Neither the nurses, doctors, nor the patients know which patients receive the drug. At the end of the study period, the number of CD4+ T cells is determined for all of the subjects. This is an example of a",
        "In a medical class of 147 students, the distribution of scores on a biochemistry final examination has a mean equal to 67, a median equal to 76, a mode equal to 80, a standard deviation equal to 5.5, and a variance equal to 30.25. Three students were unable to take the test on the scheduled date and were given a different form of the exam 1 week later. Which parameter is most likely to be the least biased estimator of central tendency for this distribution of biochemistry test scores?"
